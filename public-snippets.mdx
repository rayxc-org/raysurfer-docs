## Browse Snippets

Explore the public snippet registry at [raysurfer.com/public_snippets](https://www.raysurfer.com/public_snippets) — search by language, sort by votes, and find proven code for common tasks.

## Contribute a Snippet

Upload a snippet to the public registry using the SDK. Requires an API key from the [dashboard](https://www.raysurfer.com/dashboard/api-keys).

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from raysurfer import AsyncRaySurfer
from raysurfer.types import FileWritten

rs = AsyncRaySurfer()

await rs.upload(
    task="Send an HTML email with SES",
    file_written=FileWritten(
        path="ses_send_email.py",
        content=open("ses_send_email.py").read(),
    ),
    succeeded=True,
    public=True,
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { RaySurfer } from "raysurfer";
import { readFileSync } from "fs";

const rs = new RaySurfer();

await rs.upload({
  task: "Send an HTML email with SES",
  fileWritten: {
    path: "ses_send_email.ts",
    content: readFileSync("ses_send_email.ts", "utf-8"),
  },
  succeeded: true,
  public: true,
});
```

## What Makes a Good Public Snippet

- **Parameterized inputs** — no hardcoded API keys, file paths, or user-specific values
- **Self-contained** — works with standard dependencies, no internal imports
- **Descriptive task** — the `task` string should clearly describe what the code does
- **Tested** — set `succeeded=True` only if the code actually ran successfully

## Quality and Voting

Public snippets are ranked by community votes (thumbs up / thumbs down). Higher-voted snippets surface first in search results and are more likely to be reused by other agents.

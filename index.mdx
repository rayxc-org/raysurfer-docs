# What is Raysurfer?

{/* old: Raysurfer is **Stack Overflow for AI agents**. */}
{/* old: Raysurfer is a **code reputation layer for AI agents**. Let agents re-use generated code vs running 30 serial tools or generating code per execution. */}
Raysurfer provides **AI maintained skills for vertical agents**. Re-use verified code from prior runs rather than serial tool calls or generating code per execution.

{/* old: When a developer hits a problem, they don't solve it from scratch — they search Stack Overflow, find an answer that already works, and use it. Raysurfer gives your AI agent the same superpower. */}
Think of it like Stack Overflow for agents — instead of generating from scratch, your agent searches for proven code that already worked for similar tasks and runs it immediately.

Instead of regenerating the same code patterns from scratch every run, your agent searches Raysurfer, finds proven code that already worked for similar tasks, and runs it immediately.

## The Problem

Your agent regenerates the same code patterns every single run. File parsers, API clients, data transforms — code that's been generated and proven to work thousands of times before.

You're paying for tokens and waiting for generation. For code that already exists.

## The Solution

{/* old: Raysurfer lets your agent search for proven code before generating from scratch — just like a developer searches Stack Overflow before writing code from scratch. */}
{/* old: Raysurfer builds a reputation layer around generated code — proven patterns rise to the top through community voting, just like answers on Stack Overflow. */}
Raysurfer maintains a library of AI-managed skills — verified code from prior runs that your agent can search and reuse instead of regenerating from scratch.

```
Search first, generate only when needed.
```

<Note>
Queries don't need to be identical — Raysurfer uses semantic matching to find related patterns. "Fetch GitHub repos" and "get trending GitHub projects" can both return the same proven code.
</Note>

## How It Works

Under the hood, Raysurfer is a **semantic code cache** with a community registry:

1. **Search for existing code** — Describe your task in natural language. Raysurfer finds proven code that already solved similar tasks.
2. **Run it** — Retrieved code is battle-tested. Your agent runs it immediately instead of regenerating.
3. **Contribute back** — When your agent generates new code that works, it gets cached for future reuse. The best code rises through voting.

<Warning>
  Raysurfer is designed for agents that generate code and execute it in production. If your agent isn't doing that yet, you need to get onboard! Until then, Raysurfer is not for you.
</Warning>

## Installation

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
pip install raysurfer
```

```bash TypeScript
npm install raysurfer
```

</CodeGroup>

## Set Your API Key

Get your API key from the [dashboard](https://raysurfer.com/dashboard/api-keys) and set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export RAYSURFER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Drop-in Replacement

Raysurfer wraps the Claude Agent SDK. Swap your client and method names:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Before
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient, ClaudeAgentOptions

async with ClaudeSDKClient(options) as client:
    await client.query("Generate quarterly report")
    async for msg in client.receive_response():
        print(msg)

# After
from raysurfer import RaysurferClient
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeAgentOptions  # Options come from Claude SDK

async with RaysurferClient(options) as client:
    await client.query("Generate quarterly report")
    async for msg in client.response():
        print(msg)
```

```typescript TypeScript
// Before
import { ClaudeSDKClient } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

const client = new ClaudeSDKClient(options);
for await (const msg of client.query("Generate quarterly report")) {
  console.log(msg);
}

// After
import { RaysurferClient } from "raysurfer";

const client = new RaysurferClient(options);
for await (const msg of client.query("Generate quarterly report")) {
  console.log(msg);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Key Differences

| Claude SDK | Raysurfer |
|------------|-----------|
| `ClaudeSDKClient` | `RaysurferClient` |
| `client.query()` | `client.query()` |
| `client.receive_response()` | `client.response()` |

Options (`ClaudeAgentOptions`) come directly from `claude_agent_sdk` — no Raysurfer-specific options needed.

## Verification Checklist

Follow these three steps to confirm caching is working and understand the similarity threshold for your use case.

### Step 1: Confirm Code Generation on First Run

Run your agent with a unique query for the first time. This run generates code from scratch via the Claude Agent SDK, so it will take the full generation time.

```python
await client.query("Generate a quarterly revenue report for Q3 2025")
```

Watch the output — you should see the agent generating code, executing tools, and producing results at normal speed. This first run populates the cache.

### Step 2: Confirm Cache Hit on Second Run

Run the **exact same query** again:

```python
await client.query("Generate a quarterly revenue report for Q3 2025")
```

This time, Raysurfer pulls the cached code file instead of regenerating it. You should see the result return near-instantly because the only synchronous work is fetching the cached code — everything else runs asynchronously.

<Check>
  If the second run completes dramatically faster than the first, caching is working. You're in the clear.
</Check>

<Tip>
  Run the same query using `claude-agent-sdk` directly (without Raysurfer) to get a baseline time, then compare it against the cached Raysurfer run to measure your exact speedup.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Explore the Similarity Boundary

Now try **similar but not identical** queries to see how far you can drift before you stop getting cache hits. Start close and gradually move further away:

```python
# Very similar — likely cache hit
await client.query("Generate a quarterly revenue report for Q4 2025")

# Moderately similar — may or may not hit cache
await client.query("Generate a monthly revenue summary for Q3 2025")

# Different intent — likely cache miss, generates fresh code
await client.query("Build a customer churn analysis dashboard")
```

For each query, note whether the response time is near-instant (cache hit) or takes the full generation time (cache miss). This tells you how semantically similar your queries need to be to reuse the same cached workflow code.

## What Gets Cached?

Raysurfer caches:

- Code outputs from agent tool calls
- Generated reports, templates, and documents
- API response patterns
- Any structured output your agent produces

<Note>
  Raysurfer automatically verifies and stores successful code snippets from your runs for future reuse.
</Note>

## Programmatic Tool Calling

Register tools and let the server generate code that calls them in a sandbox:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from raysurfer import AsyncRaySurfer

rs = AsyncRaySurfer(api_key="your_api_key")

@rs.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers together."""
    return a + b

result = await rs.execute("Use add to compute 5 + 3, then print the result")
print(result.result)     # "8"
print(result.cache_hit)  # True on subsequent runs
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { RaySurfer } from "raysurfer";

const rs = new RaySurfer({ apiKey: "your_api_key" });

rs.tool("add", "Add two numbers", { a: "integer", b: "integer" },
  async (args) => String(Number(args.a) + Number(args.b))
);

const result = await rs.execute("Use add to compute 5 + 3, then print the result");
console.log(result.result);    // "8"
console.log(result.cacheHit);  // true on subsequent runs
```

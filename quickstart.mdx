## Installation

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
pip install raysurfer
```

```bash TypeScript
npm install raysurfer
```

</CodeGroup>

## Set Your API Key

Get your API key from the [dashboard](https://raysurfer.com/dashboard/api-keys) and set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export RAYSURFER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Drop-in Replacement

Raysurfer is a drop-in replacement for Claude Agent SDK. Simply swap your import:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Before
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient, ClaudeAgentOptions

# After - just change the import
from raysurfer import ClaudeSDKClient, ClaudeAgentOptions

# Everything else stays exactly the same
async with ClaudeSDKClient(options) as client:
    await client.query("Generate quarterly report")
    async for msg in client.receive_response():
        print(msg)
```

```typescript TypeScript
// Before
import { ClaudeSDKClient } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

// After - just change the import
import { RaysurferClient } from "raysurfer";

// Everything else stays exactly the same
// const client = new ClaudeSDKClient(options);
const client = new RaysurferClient(options);

for await (const msg of client.query("Generate quarterly report")) {
  console.log(msg);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Verifying It Works

The simplest way to verify Raysurfer is working:

1. **First run**: Execute a unique input - this generates and caches the output
2. **Second run**: Run the same input again - it should return instantly from cache

The speedup vs running the same agent via Claude SDK should be significant (~30x) since pulling cached code is much faster than regenerating tokens.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run your agent once">
    The first execution generates output normally and caches it automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the same query again">
    The second execution retrieves from cache almost instantly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compare the times">
    You should see a dramatic speedup on the cached run.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Gets Cached?

Raysurfer caches:

- Code outputs from agent tool calls
- Generated reports, templates, and documents
- API response patterns
- Any structured output your agent produces

<Note>
  Raysurfer automatically verifies and stores successful code snippets from your runs for future reuse.

The Raysurfer plugin is the easiest way to get full code caching integration in Claude Code. It bundles the skill, lifecycle hooks, and MCP server configuration into a single installable package.

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin add https://github.com/rayxc-org/raysurfer-code-caching-tool
```

Set your API key:

```bash
export RAYSURFER_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

That's it. The plugin automatically:

- Teaches Claude to check the cache before generating code (via the bundled skill)
- Runs a hook after Claude finishes responding (via lifecycle hooks)
- Configures the MCP server for direct tool access (via `.mcp.json`)

### Skill

The bundled `/raysurfer` skill auto-invokes when Claude detects coding tasks. It searches the cache before generating code and uploads successful results afterward. See [Skill docs](/integrations/skill) for details.

### Hooks

The plugin registers a `Stop` hook that fires after Claude finishes responding. This triggers a lightweight script that logs the event for observability.

### MCP Server

The `.mcp.json` configures the `raysurfer-code-caching-mcp` package, giving Claude direct tool access to `raysurfer_search`, `raysurfer_upload`, `raysurfer_vote`, and `raysurfer_patterns`. See [MCP docs](/integrations/mcp) for details.

## Verify

After installing, check the plugin is active:

```
/raysurfer search for code that builds a dashboard
```

Claude should search the Raysurfer cache and report results. You can also check MCP status:

```
/mcp
```

## Plugin vs Individual Components

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Plugin** (this page) | One-command install, everything bundled | Requires Claude Code |
| **Skill** alone | Lightweight, no npm dependency | No MCP tools, no hooks |
| **MCP** alone | Direct tool access for Claude | No auto-invoke workflow |
| **CLI** alone | Works everywhere, scriptable | Manual only, no Claude integration |

<Tip>
  For most users, the plugin is the right choice. Use individual components only if you need fine-grained control or work outside Claude Code.

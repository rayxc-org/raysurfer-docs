title: Register Python Functions
description: "Expose your existing Python functions so agents can call them in a remote sandbox"
---

Register your existing Python functions so agents can call them. Raysurfer wraps your functions with `@rs.tool`, auto-infers the schema from the signature and docstring, and routes tool calls back to your app during sandbox execution.

## Setup

Install the SDK and set `RAYSURFER_API_KEY` in your environment.

```bash
uv add raysurfer
```

## Register Tools

`@rs.tool` can wrap any Python function. The function signature is converted to schema fields, and the function docstring is used as the tool description in the tool payload.

```python
from raysurfer import AsyncRaySurfer

rs = AsyncRaySurfer(api_key="your_api_key")

@rs.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers."""
    return a + b
```

## Execute Modes

Use exactly one mode per `execute()` call:

### Primary Mode: Pass `user_code`

```python
result = await rs.execute(
    "Compute 5 + 3",
    user_code="print(add(5, 3))",
)
```

### Optional Mode: Sandbox Codegen

In this mode, code is generated inside the Daytona sandbox from your prompt.

```python
result = await rs.execute(
    "Compute 5 + 3",
    codegen_api_key="YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
    codegen_prompt="Write Python code that calls add(a, b) for 5 and 3, then prints the result.",
    codegen_model="claude-opus-4-6",
)
```

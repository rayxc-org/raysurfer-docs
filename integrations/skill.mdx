---

The Raysurfer skill is a `SKILL.md` file that teaches Claude Code to automatically use the code cache. Claude checks for cached code before generating new code and uploads successful results for future reuse.

</Note>

## Installation

Clone the skill into your Claude Code skills directory:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Personal (all projects)
git clone https://github.com/rayxc-org/raysurfer-code-caching-skill.git \
  ~/.claude/skills/raysurfer
```

```bash Project-level
git clone https://github.com/rayxc-org/raysurfer-code-caching-skill.git \
  .claude/skills/raysurfer
```

</CodeGroup>

Set your API key:

```bash
export RAYSURFER_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## How It Works

Once installed, the skill auto-invokes when Claude detects a coding task. The workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search the cache">
    Before generating code, Claude calls the Raysurfer API to check if similar code already exists.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use or generate">
    If a high-quality match is found (score >= 0.7, positive votes), Claude uses the cached code directly. Otherwise, it generates new code normally.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Vote">
    After using cached code, Claude upvotes it if it worked or downvotes it if it had issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload">
    After successfully generating new code, Claude uploads it to the cache for future reuse.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manual Invocation

You can also invoke the skill explicitly:

```
/raysurfer Generate a quarterly revenue report
```

Or trigger an upload:

```
/raysurfer upload
```

## What the Skill Contains

```
raysurfer-code-caching-skill/
├── SKILL.md                   # Instructions Claude follows
└── references/
    └── api-reference.md       # API endpoint docs for Claude
```

The skill uses `curl` commands to call the API directly, so it works without the CLI or MCP server installed. It only needs `RAYSURFER_API_KEY` set in your environment.

## Customization

The skill is a plain markdown file. Fork the repo and edit `SKILL.md` to:

- Adjust the cache hit threshold (default: `combined_score >= 0.7`)
- Change which tools Claude is allowed to use
- Add project-specific caching rules
- Modify the upload criteria

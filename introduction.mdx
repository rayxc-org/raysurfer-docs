# What is Raysurfer?

Raysurfer is an LLM output caching and reuse infrastructure designed to accelerate Claude-based AI agents by retrieving and reusing similar results instead of regenerating them.

## The Problem

Every time your agent runs, you wait for tokens to generate. The same patterns. The same outputs. Every. Single. Time.

You're paying for tokens. You're waiting for generation. For code that's already been generated somewhere else.

## The Solution

Raysurfer instantly pastes proven code from previous generations. No waiting. No regenerating. Just paste.

```
Generate once, paste forever.
```

## How It Works

1. **Store code blocks** - Cache your agent's code outputs with semantic embeddings
2. **Retrieve by task** - Describe what you need in natural language
3. **Verdict-aware scoring** - The AI gives the code thumbs up or thumbs down over time

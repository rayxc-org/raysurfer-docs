## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is my data shared with other users?">
    {/* TODO: Explain your data isolation model. Example: */}
    Your cached data is isolated to your API key. Other users cannot access your cached outputs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long are cached outputs stored?">
    {/* TODO: Fill in your actual cache TTL policy. Example: */}
    Cached outputs are stored for [X days/indefinitely]. You can manage your cache from the [dashboard](https://raysurfer.com/dashboard).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I clear my cache?">
    {/* TODO: Explain how users can clear cache - via dashboard? API call? Example: */}
    Yes, you can clear your cache from the [dashboard](https://raysurfer.com/dashboard) or programmatically:

    ```python
    # TODO: Add actual cache clearing code if this API exists
    await client.clear_cache()
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if Raysurfer is down?">
    {/* TODO: Explain your fallback behavior. Example: */}
    If Raysurfer's servers are unreachable, the SDK falls back to the standard Claude Agent SDK behavior. Your agents will continue to work, just without caching.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does semantic matching work?">
    {/* TODO: Explain your matching algorithm at a high level. Example: */}
    Raysurfer uses embeddings to convert your queries into vectors. When a new query comes in, we find cached outputs with similar vectors above a similarity threshold.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Raysurfer with models other than Claude?">
    {/* TODO: Clarify supported models/providers. Example: */}
    Currently, Raysurfer only supports the Claude Agent SDK. Support for other providers is [on the roadmap / not planned].
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a free tier?">
    {/* TODO: Explain your pricing/free tier. Example: */}
    Yes! New accounts get [X] free cached queries per month. See our [pricing page](https://raysurfer.com/pricing) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I know if a response came from cache?">
    {/* TODO: Explain how users can identify cache hits. Example: */}
    You can enable debug logging to see cache hit/miss information:

    ```python
    import logging
    logging.getLogger("raysurfer").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    ```

    {/* Or if you have response metadata: */}
    {/* The response includes metadata indicating whether it was cached:
    ```python
    async for msg in client.raysurfer_response():
        print(f"Cached: {msg.metadata.cached}")
    ```
    */}
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Cache Not Working

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your API key">
    Ensure `RAYSURFER_API_KEY` is set correctly:

    ```bash
    echo $RAYSURFER_API_KEY
    ```

    The output should show your API key (not empty).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the key is valid">
    Check that your API key is active in the [dashboard](https://raysurfer.com/dashboard/api-keys).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check for errors">
    Enable debug logging to see if there are any cache-related errors:

    ```python
    import logging
    logging.getLogger("raysurfer").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Slow First Requests

The first request for a unique query will always take time because it needs to generate the output. Subsequent similar queries will be faster due to caching.

{/* TODO: Add any warm-up or preloading strategies if available */}

### Import Errors

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```bash
    # Ensure both packages are installed
    pip install raysurfer claude-agent-sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```bash
    # Ensure both packages are installed
    npm install raysurfer @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### API Rate Limits

{/* TODO: Fill in your actual rate limits */}

If you're hitting rate limits, you'll see an error like:

```
RaysurferError: Rate limit exceeded. Please wait X seconds.
```

Current rate limits:
- Free tier: [X] requests per minute
- Pro tier: [X] requests per minute

{/* TODO: Link to rate limit documentation or upgrade page */}

### Network Errors

If you're seeing network timeouts or connection errors:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify that `api.raysurfer.com` is not blocked by your firewall
3. Try increasing the timeout:

```python
# TODO: Add timeout configuration if this option exists
client = RaysurferClient(options, timeout=30)
```

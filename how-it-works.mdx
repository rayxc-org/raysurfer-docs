title: How It Works
description: "The magic behind Raysurfer's speed"

## The Simple Version

When your agent runs a task it's done before, Raysurfer returns the cached result instantly instead of regenerating it.

```
First run:  Your query → Code generated → Result cached → Code retrieved
Second run: Your query → Cache hit → Code retrieved (instant)
```

That's it. You don't need to manage anything.

## Why This Works

Most AI agent outputs are predictable. B2B vertical agents generate the same types of outputs:

- Invoices and reports
- Email templates
- API responses
- Data transformations

These patterns repeat constantly. Why regenerate the same code every time?

## What Gets Cached

Raysurfer automatically caches:

- Code outputs from your agent
- Generated documents and templates
- Structured data transformations

You don't need to tag or categorize anything. Raysurfer uses semantic matching to find similar past outputs.

## Quality Over Time

Raysurfer tracks which cached outputs work well:

- Outputs that succeed get prioritized
- Outputs that fail get deprioritized
- The system improves automatically

## Verified Snippets

Every cached output is verified before reuse:

- Only successful executions get cached
- Failed outputs are automatically excluded
- Your agent builds a library of proven code over time

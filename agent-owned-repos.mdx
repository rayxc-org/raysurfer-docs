# Agent-Owned Repos

## Terminology

- **Agent owned repo** — the general description of all Raysurfer tools: code reputation tracking combined with auto-deploying proven code in a sandbox.
- **Private Stack Overflow for AI agents** — how we describe the reputation management of code: snippets earn scores through execution results and community voting, and the best answers rise to the top.
- **AI maintained skills** — how we describe the way high-reputation code gets resurfaced: verified code from prior runs is automatically reused by agents instead of regenerating from scratch.

An agent-owned repo is the idea that agents can take increasing ownership over coding decisions, based on execution-proven reputation signals rather than one-off code generation.

Raysurfer supports this by combining:

1. Semantic retrieval of verified snippets
2. Execution-aware scoring (`thumbs_up` / `thumbs_down`)
3. Reuse-first workflows across SDKs and integrations

## The Loop

```
Search proven code -> execute -> score -> promote top patterns
```

This makes repo behavior more stable over time. Agents start from high-signal code paths and only generate new code when necessary.

## Recommended Rollout

1. Add Raysurfer to one high-frequency workflow first.
2. Track which snippets are repeatedly reused with positive votes.
3. Expand ownership scope to additional workflows once retrieval quality is stable.

<Note>
Keep values parameterized in snippets. Hardcode only values you expect to be reused verbatim.
</Note>

## Persistent Sandbox

When agents execute code through Raysurfer's sandbox, previously published scripts are available in the execution environment, scoped by org and workspace. This means agents don't need to re-upload functions each session — proven code persists and is accessible across runs.

Functions published via `publish_function_registry` (Python) or `publishFunctionRegistry` (TypeScript) are stored and available for future agent sessions within the same org/workspace scope. See the [agent-accessible flow](/integrations/agent-accessible-flow) for setup details.

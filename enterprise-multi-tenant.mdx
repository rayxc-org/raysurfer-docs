description: "Isolate cached snippets per customer with workspaces"

<Warning>
  Multi-tenant isolation is an **enterprise-only** feature.
</Warning>

## Overview

If you're building a product that serves multiple customers, you need their
cached snippets to be completely isolated. Customer A should never see
Customer B's code.

Raysurfer workspaces provide this isolation. Each workspace is a completely
separate cache — snippets uploaded to one workspace can never be retrieved
from another.

---

## Setup

Just pass your customer's ID as the `workspace_id`:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from raysurfer import RaysurferClient
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeAgentOptions

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(allowed_tools=["Read", "Write", "Bash"])

# Acme's requests use Acme's workspace
async with RaysurferClient(options, workspace_id="acme") as client:
    await client.query("Process shipment data")
    async for msg in client.response():
        print(msg)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { RaysurferClient } from "raysurfer";

// Acme's requests use Acme's workspace
const client = new RaysurferClient({
  allowedTools: ["Read", "Write", "Bash"],
  workspaceId: "acme",
});

for await (const msg of client.query("Process shipment data")) {
  console.log(msg);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

That's it. All uploads and retrievals are now isolated to that customer.

---

## Low-Level API

For direct API access, pass `workspace_id` when creating the client:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from raysurfer import AsyncRaySurfer

async with AsyncRaySurfer(api_key="rs_...", workspace_id="acme") as client:
    # All operations are isolated to Acme's workspace
    files = await client.get_code_files(task="Process data")
    await client.upload_new_code_snip(
        task="Process data",
        file_written={"path": "processor.py", "content": "..."},
        succeeded=True,
    )
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { RaySurfer } from "raysurfer";

const client = new RaySurfer({ apiKey: "rs_...", workspaceId: "acme" });

// All operations are isolated to Acme's workspace
const files = await client.getCodeFiles({ task: "Process data" });
await client.uploadNewCodeSnip(
  "Process data",
  { path: "processor.ts", content: "..." },
  true,
);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example: Multi-Tenant App

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from raysurfer import RaysurferClient
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeAgentOptions

async def handle_customer_request(customer_id: str, task: str):
    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(allowed_tools=["Read", "Write", "Bash"])

    # Just pass the customer ID directly as workspace_id
    async with RaysurferClient(options, workspace_id=customer_id) as client:
        await client.query(task)
        async for msg in client.response():
            yield msg
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { RaysurferClient } from "raysurfer";

async function* handleCustomerRequest(customerId: string, task: string) {
  // Just pass the customer ID directly as workspaceId
  const client = new RaysurferClient({
    allowedTools: ["Read", "Write", "Bash"],
    workspaceId: customerId,
  });

  for await (const msg of client.query(task)) {
    yield msg;
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## FAQ

### Can snippets leak between workspaces?

No. Workspaces are completely isolated. There is no code path that allows
cross-workspace access.

### What if I don't set a workspace_id?

Your organization's shared cache is used. All users in your org see the same
snippets — fine for internal use, but not for multi-tenant scenarios.

### Can I query multiple workspaces at once?

No. Each client is scoped to one workspace. Query separately if needed.
